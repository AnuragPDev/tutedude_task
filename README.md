**Task1**
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: ")) 
num2= int(input("enter the second number: "))
print("Addition: ", num1+num2)
print("Subtraction: ", num1-num2)
print("Multiplication: ", num1*num2)
print("Division: ", num1/num2)
**Explaination**
The idea is to take user input for two numbers num1 and num2, since we know input functions takes input as string so we can type cast the input by using int function, the print function print the out to the terminal and it has two parts one is what we are doing and other is logic behind it like addition subtraction , multiplication and division
and hence gives the desired output 

**Task 2**
first_name = input("Enter your first name: ")
last_name = input("Enter your second name: ")
print("Hello", first_name + last_name,"welcome to my github repo")
**Explaination**

Taking two input from the user to print their fist and last name , and using print statement to print the user name with random greetings
