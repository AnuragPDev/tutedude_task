# Problem Statement: Write a Python program that does the following:
# 1.  Takes two numbers as input from the user.
# 2.  Performs the basic mathematical operations on these two numbers:
# o	Addition
# o	Subtraction
# o	Multiplication
# o	Division
# 3.  Displays the results of each operation on the screen.
#  Expected Output:
# The output should include the result of each operation performed, for example:
 
num1 = int(input("Enter the first number: "))
num2= int(input("enter the second number: "))
print("Addition: ", num1+num2)
print("Subtraction: ", num1-num2)
print("Multiplication: ", num1*num2)
print("Division: ", num1/num2)
